## ***The Story***

![alt text](./static/images/3d-delivery-robot-working.jpg)

At first, I was required to do a project and had a few options to consider. However, an idea struck me suddenly: why not create a website that integrates artificial intelligence into its functionality? I noticed that many marketing sites do not leverage AI services, and I thought, **"Why not create a marketing site similar to Amazon, but with AI capabilities?"**

The challenge, though, was that I had only two weeks to complete the project. To add to the difficulty, I am a nursing student, and **my final exams were scheduled to start in the second week of the project timeline.** This tight schedule left me feeling frustrated and contemplating whether I should simplify the project to make it more manageable. But I decided to push through and commit to creating the AI-powered marketing site, regardless of the time constraints and hard work involved.

I was aware that completing the project within the given time frame would be tough, but I resolved to do my best and produce as much as I could. I began by organizing my time and breaking down the project into manageable parts.

Initially, I thought about developing the front-end and back-end simultaneously, but I realized that this approach might lead to compatibility issues. Therefore, I decided to start with the back-end development first.

I focused on building the core functionalities related to the products:

- Adding a product.
- Modifying product data.
- Displaying all existing products.
- Deleting a product.

I was thrilled to complete this part in less than four days, with everything working perfectly and the data stored in a JSON file.

Next, I moved on to the user-related functionalities:

- Creating user accounts.
- Implementing the login system.
- Managing user sessions and authentication.

The third part involved cart management functionalities for users:

- Adding products to the user's cart.
- Calculating the total price of products in the cart.
- Removing products from the cart.

I was delighted to finish this part as well, and it all worked seamlessly with MySQL, storing data effectively. By the end of the first week, I had completed the back-end development, which was a significant milestone.

Despite the challenges, including my exam preparations, I managed to build a functional back-end within a week. This experience taught me valuable lessons about time management, perseverance, and the importance of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, achievable goals.

**The second part of the project focused on the front-end development.** By this time, the second week had started, **and I had three exams to prepare for and complete.** This period was exceptionally challenging as I had to balance my academic responsibilities with the demands of the project. Despite the heavy workload, I dedicated whatever time I could to work on the front-end.

I developed the user interface, ensuring it was intuitive and user-friendly. The front-end needed to interact smoothly with the back-end, displaying product information, user details, and cart contents accurately. This involved a lot of testing and debugging to ensure everything functioned as expected.

Throughout the second week, I often felt that the project was incomplete and far from my original vision. **The pressure of exams and the complexity of integrating AI features left me feeling overwhelmed at times**. However, I persevered, knowing that even if the project wasn't perfect, it was a significant learning experience and a step towards achieving my goal.

Despite the challenges, I managed to create a functional front-end that met the basic requirements. I knew there was much more to be done, and the site needed further improvements to fully realize its potential. However, **I took pride in what I had accomplished within such a short period.**

This project taught me invaluable lessons about time management, problem-solving, and the importance of perseverance. It also deepened my understanding of web development and artificial intelligence, fueling my passion for creating innovative solutions. **I look forward to continuing to develop Master Market, adding more features, and refining its capabilities to create a truly remarkable e-commerce platform.**
